## Final Project: Underwater Fantasy Exploration
This project implements an underwater fantasy environment in OpenGL with C++. The user gets to see a variety of marine animals moving around the scenery, see marine plants that give a more underwater feel to the environment, and explore artifacts that reside in the environment. 

## Instructions
To run the environment in Visual Studio, click on the [Graphics_1.sln](https://github.com/GelsonSze/CSC767M-Project/blob/main/visual_studio/Graphics_1.sln) file to load the VS Code solution. Click on the `Local Windows Debugger` button to compile and run the environment. This also produces an `Graphics_1.exe` file that can be run anytime without needing to recompile the solution.

Once the program is running, you can use the following keys to move around the environment:
- `W` - go upwards in the environment
- `A` - go downwards in the environment
- `S` - go left in the environment
- `D` - go right in the environment

You may also hold the left mouse button and drag your mouse around to look at other areas of the environment within your view.

## Additional Features
This environment makes use of shadow mapping, which allows shadows to be cast on the objects. TODO
